## JS:

### Exercise 5.1:

 Using Async/Await and Generators, create separate functions and achieve the same functionality. **(3hours)**
 
 Execute 3 callback functions asynchronously, for example doTask1(), doTask2() and doTask3().
 
 #### Guidelines:
 
 1. 2 functions should be created. One for Async/Await and the other one for Generators.
 2. 3rd party libraries should not be used.
 3. Custom Function should carry a meaningful name.
 4. The program should execute without errors.
 5. The program should achieve the desired result.
 6. The program should take care of all 3 states of a Promise.
 7. Should be committed to Git with meaningful commit messages.
 
 #### Outcome:
 
 1. Under the hood understanding of how a Generator works. 
 2. Under the hood understanding of how Async/await works.
 
 
### Exercise 5.2:

 Write a function called vowelCount which accepts a string and returns a map where the keys are numbers and the values are the count of the vowels in the string.
 
 #### Guidelines:
 
 1. JS function should have Map API implemented.
 2. Map’s set functionality should have been used.
 3. Bonus - if space and time complexity is taken care.
 
 
 #### Outcome:
 
 1. Understanding of Map API and its functionalities.
 
 
### Exercise 5.3:

 Write a function called hasDuplicate which accepts an array and returns true or false if that array contains a duplicate.
 
 #### Guidelines:
 
 1. JS function should have Set API implemented.
 2. Bonus - if space and time complexity is taken care.

 #### Outcome:
 
 1. Understanding of Set API and its functionalities.
 
 
### Exercise 5.4:

 Create a simple Javascript function code for addition, subtraction, and multiplication of 2 numbers and write the corresponding Jest based tests for it.
 
 #### Guidelines:
 
 1. Jest should’ve been installed.
 2. Package.json file should have the config for running test cases.
 3. Test case file should’ve been created. For example: `calculator.test.js` 
 4. BDD style tests for each function should’ve been created for the same.
 5. All test cases should pass.
 6. Reference: https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/jest-testing-tutorial/
 
 #### Outcome:
 
 1. Understanding the importance of writing test cases.
 2. How BDD works.
 3. What are the packages required for writing test cases?
 4. How to configure test cases in package.json file
